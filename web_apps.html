										<h1>Is the Mobile Application Dead?</h1>

									<p>Native mobile apps are a little weird, if you stop and think about them.</p>
									<p>The average mobile app weighs around 20MB, often requires an internet connection in order to be used as intended, and issues several data-heavy updates during its lifetime. Some of these mobile apps have a web version that contains all or most of the same features, at nearly 1/20th of the size.</p>
									<p>When you buy a mobile phone, a lot of these apps come preinstalled, and can be difficult to remove from your device. There is an app for every use you can think of, but every download means less available storage on your device. Many native apps have specific and trivial use cases (calculators, alarm clocks, sound recorders), while still having large file sizes and internet connection requirements.</p>
									<p>If you’re a developer, it only gets weirder. You can’t just make an app and release it into the wild. You first have to get it approved it on some marketplace to be seen, which can be a difficult and expensive process ($99 USD on apple app store). If you want to make your app available to a wider audience (apple, android, and Firefox OS), you have to release separate versions, which include additional marketplace approval processes and plenty of extra development time.</p>

											<h2>The Problem</h2>
											<p>Although native mobile applications are useful and entertaining, they’re also a giant inconvenience.</p>
											<p>For developers, they’re difficult to develop if your skill set revolves around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re difficult to get on a marketplace, because of tightly controlled requirements and licensing fees. They’re difficult to support because of multiple software versions and device incompatibilities. As an Android user, I’ve come across several great apps that I’d love to install and use, but am unable to because they only exist for iPhone users. This is an upsetting (albeit “first world”) problem, but I can’t blame the developers of the app, because supporting just one platform is difficult enough!</p>
											<p>For users, they’re difficult to install because of bandwidth constraints, file sizes, and frequent updates (open your application manager on your phone and see how many of your apps need or have recently downloaded an update). How many times have you had to uninstall an app on your device to make room for a more important one?</p>
											<p>Let’s not forget that several mobile applications have web versions that have the same content and capabilities, negating the need for an app in the first place.</p>
											<p>So native mobile applications are difficult for both users and developers alike. But developers keep building them, users continue to download them, and everyone keeps complaining. So is there a solution to the problem of native mobile applications, or are we stuck with the problems we have?</p>

											<h2>The Solution</h2>
											<p>The solution is the browser. Remember when I said that most applications require some form of an internet connection to work properly? Well truthfully, all applications require an internet connection to work properly, because without the internet, you can’t download any applications. We use the internet to download applications and updates for them, and often to send and receive application-related data.</p>
											<p>If all our applications depend so heavily on the internet, why don’t we just keep them there? This is exactly what a web app does. A web app relies on the browser and its capabilities to render the application, whereas a native mobile app relies on the device and its capabilities to render the application.</p>
											<p>Web apps cause plenty of native mobile application headaches to disappear. If you’re a developer, you only need HTML, CSS, and Javascript to start building your application! In some cases, your application can be completely static, meaning you don’t need to rely on any server side processing.</p>
											<p>Although marketplaces for web apps do exist, the user doesn’t need to go to one to download your application. Web apps live in the browser, which means your users can navigate to a URL to use your application, and installation is as simple as bookmarking a website. Developers can also avoid the need to make several different versions depending on their users’ operating systems.</p>
											<p>Web apps are great for users, especially because they make distribution and installation so easy. They also eliminate size constraints, which means no more having to uninstall an application in order to make room for more! Updating a web application for a user is a seamless process, requiring nothing more than a browser refresh.</p>
