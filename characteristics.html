										<h1>10 Characteristics of a Good Programmer</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic24.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>You know how to program and your now looking for a job, here are 10 characteristics of a programmer that employers look for when interviewing. We will also provide some sample interview questions that you might be asked in an interview. </p>

									<h2>1. Impressive technical skills.</h2>
									<p>One mistake many hiring managers make is hiring from a checklist of requirements. Instead of requiring three years of C++ and one year of Java, look at the big picture. A programmer who has worked mostly in an older language but has recently added a new language to his certifications may be the perfect fit, since his years of experience give him a great foundation in other areas of programming.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> Describe your experience with different programming languages.</p>

									<h2>2. Willingness to learn.</h2>
									<p>Technology is always evolving and the skills and abilities a programmer has today will likely be outdated in a few years. It’s important to find a programmer who has an interest in following the latest trends and is eager to participate in any continuing education opportunities that are available.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> What do you do to keep your programming skills current? </p>

									<h2>3. Debugging skills.</h2>
									<p>Creating code is only part of a programmer’s job. When software doesn’t work as expected, a programmer is expected to get to the root of the problem quickly and effectively. Instead of spending hours blindly making changes, search for a programmer who prefers to carefully investigate his code and research possible issues until an answer is found.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> How do you handle bugs in your code? </p>

									<h2>4. Work environment match.</h2>
									<p>Some programmers require complete silence to concentrate, while others thrive in chaos. A worker’s personal preferences are an important part of his productivity, so it’s best to be clear about your office environment up front to avoid problems after the person is hired.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question: </b> Describe your ideal work environment.</p>

									<h2>5. Problem-solving skills.</h2>
									<p>For those who have never attempted to create an application from scratch, programming can best be compared to solving an extremely difficult math equation. A good programmer thrives on finding ways to make something work, despite the odds. Otherwise, you may be hearing the phrase, “That can’t be done,” every time you propose an innovative new project.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question: </b> How would you create (insert near impossible task for an organization)? </p>

									<h2>6. Passion for the work.</h2>
									<p>While some programming staff can simply serve as nine-to-fivers, many hiring managers are interested in finding someone who will gladly put in long hours when the situation merits it. Often these employees can be found during the interview process by their outside interests. True programmers are self-proclaimed “computer geeks,” spending their time gaming, building servers, or creating apps for friends. While this passion isn’t a necessity, it’s often a way to find top-shelf candidates.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> What are your hobbies?</p>

									<h2>7. Grace under fire.</h2>
									<p>It may not seem like it to the outsider, but programming can be an extremely stressful profession. When deadlines are tight and nothing seems to be working, it’s easy to freeze up. The ideal programming candidate will be able to handle even the most stressful situations calmly and, most importantly, be able to continue working.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> Describe a time when you were under extreme pressure and your application wasn’t working. What did you do? </p>

									<h2>8. People skills.</h2>
									<p>Programmers generally aren’t expected to have heavy-duty customer service talents. It seems to be understood at the outset that they’ll mostly be sitting in front of a computer all day. Yet programmers are regularly expected to interact with managers, co-workers, and clients, so the ability to work well with others is a must. This is especially true if your programmers are occasionally asked to participate in client meetings and explain how a system works.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> Explain how your favorite application works in a way a layman would understand. </p>

									<h2>9. A business perspective.</h2>
									<p>It’s easy to lose sight of the big picture while focusing on creating one piece of software. The ideal programmer has a business focus that allows him to move beyond the current application. A business-focused programmer will suggest ideas for new applications that can improve operations.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> </p>

									<h2>10. Ability to plan.</h2>
									<p>Rather than jumping into a new assignment, a good addition to your programming staff will first learn as much as possible about the desired end product. Once he’s completed that analysis, the programmer will first design the program structure before typing the first line of code.</p>
									<p><b>Sample interview question:</b> Explain your approach to a new design. What do you do first? </p>
