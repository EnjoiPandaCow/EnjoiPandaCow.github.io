										<h1>5 Myths About Programmers</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Do you dream of becoming a computer programmer, but think you’re not (and never will be) cut out for the job? Turns out you’re probably wrong -- and here’s why.</p>

									<h2>Myth 1. I need to be a prodigy to be a developer.</h2>
									<p>People often think programmers are a special breed of humanity, born with scientific calculators for brains. On the contrary, developers are ordinary people who simply have a passion for programming. And like in any profession, talent only gets people so far, as work ethic and discipline truly determine success or failure.</p>
									<p>If you’re curious to learn programming, don’t worry; it’s not as difficult as it may seem. At its core, programming is simply a form of communication between two entities — in this case, a developer and a computer. At a fundamental level, your task as a developer is to give instructions to a computer on how to build something, such as a website.</p>
									<p>But of course you don’t simply say, “Computer, build me a website.” It’s more complex than that. In a nutshell, programming is like writing meticulous instruction manuals in a special language, which only computers and other programmers can interpret.</p>

									<h2>Myth 2. It’s too late for me to become a developer. </h2>
									<p>The truth is it’s never too late to become a computer programmer. Lots of coding bootcamps work with students of all ages and from a wide variety of backgrounds. Many enroll with little programming experience. As long as they put in the required work, they’re able to find great success, both in the classroom and in the workforce after graduation.</p>
									<p>Even though you may be starting your career in programming later than you would have wished, you’ll find that you have everything you need to succeed with the right preparation and work ethic.</p>

									<h2>Myth 3. I need a Computer Science degree to become a developer.</h2>
									<p>Have you noticed all the coding bootcamps popping up around the world? These bootcamps wouldn’t stay in business long if they weren’t succeeding as viable alternatives to conventional schools. (Disclaimer: I work for one.) Every month, graduates of these bootcamps — who often begin the camps with limited experience in programming — land jobs as developers.</p>
									<p>And if you throw in the increasing popularity of free online learning platforms like Codecademy, it’s evident that learning to program is not an opportunity exclusive to formal institutions.</p>
									<p>Programming is like almost any profession: if you’re good at it, people will pay you for your skills, regardless of how you got there.</p>

									<h2>Myth 4.  I need serious math skills to become a developer</h2>
									<p>To become a developer, you don’t need to know how to approximate a definite integral using a parabolic variable. You don’t even need to know what this means. All you need is basic algebra, logic, strong problem-solving skills, and most of all, patience.</p>
									<p>This doesn’t mean developers never use advanced math. If the project at hand requires complex mathematical computation, then you will definitely need to brush up on your math skills. However, there are many plugins and libraries available to run calculations for you. All you have to do is implement the plugin or library into your code, so being extremely proficient at math is not necessarily required to become a developer.</p>

									<h2>Myth 5. I need to learn the “best” programming language to become a developer</h2>
									<p>A common question beginners ask is, “What is the best language to learn?” It’s a good question, but also a misguided one. No computer language is “better” than another, in the same way that French is not “better” than Spanish. Just as the benefit of a spoken language depends on what country you are visiting, the benefit of a computer language depends on what you need to do.</p>
									<p>A better question to ask is, “Which programming language should I learn first?” If you want to be a great developer, you’ll need to master multiple languages.</p>
									<p>The best approach is to start with the fundamentals. If you want to be a web developer, start with HTML and CSS, which are the foundational languages of the web. If you’re more interested in general computer programming, focus on languages that have a lot of online documentation and tutorials to supplement your learning, and don’t worry about the “best” language. As your learning progresses, the strengths and weaknesses of each language will reveal themselves.</p>
