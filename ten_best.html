									<p>These days, skilled programmers are in great demand. Over the past decade, coding jobs have become mainstream, creating millions of employment opportunities every year. Those who already have programming knowledge, are taking the polyglot approach. These programmers are learning programming other languages and improving their skill sets. By leveraging multiple languages, they are able to solve a problem with greater ease.</p>
									<p>When learning a new language, it is suggested that one must take a look at the latest trends. This gives us a pretty strong idea about the future and how much a language can grow in usage and importance. This automatically tells us the employment opportunities. Here, in this article, I’m going to use GitHub’s data to tell you the most popular programming languages that one needs to learn in 2017.</p>

                                    <div class="row">
